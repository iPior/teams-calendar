# teams-calendar

To Do
1. Add following weeks to the calendar

- At the start of the year, create an array for every week in the calendar.
- Start the calendar on the current week
- every button submit, reload the page with the next week/last week
- save all weeks in the local storage as data

possible issues to consider: edge cases
- the day of the year that the calendar starts
- the day of the year that the calendar ends

- Grey out past weeks and disable

Bugs:
1. If the first word of the title or desccription is too long it spills out of the box
5. hour long activities resize bad and bleed
