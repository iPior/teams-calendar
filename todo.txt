HTML
That makes sense, changes implemented


CSS
I will look into BEM

I actually just spent some time learning about SASS and thought the CSS nesting was neat. I did not know this was capable in vanilla CSS so i will go back
and implement that to the code.

I am interested in learning more about Tailwind. I have  experience using bootstrap personally but for this project 
I chose to keep this project simple with just CSS. Projects going forward I will definitely be trying out tailwind. 

I impelemnted variables for those hex colors

Javascript
This is interesting. I did intend on modularizing my JS I was just unsure how. My original thoughts were to go have a JS file per component but I used your 
suggestions of initliaziation, event handlers, util functions. 


My Notes:
I did not make this site responsive, I just wanted to utlizize the javascript skills I had just learnt. Should I try to make this site responsive or move onto the
React. 

Can this project be included as part of my portfolio as I work towards finding a junior level frontend job?

React vs Angular vs Vue, which do I start with??

Should I learn typescript??
