# Weekly Planner

This is a recreated version of Microsoft's Teams Calendar using the basics (HTML, CSS, and Javascript).

Upon loading the page, the current week will be displayed. To add an activity or meeting, simply press on the timeslots which is highlighted with a hover effect to open up the modal. Current day and and time are also highlighted to help navigate the calendar. 

Every meeting has a title, duration, location, and description. Additionally, meetings can be color coded by choosing one of the 8 default colors as well as deleted or editied if necessary.

Lastly, you can plan ahead or view previous weeks using the arrows at the top right of the calendar. Weeks in the past will be disabled, but previous activities will still be accessible. 

Notes: 
- Only 30 minute and 60 minute durations were implemented. 
- 30 minute activities will not display descriptions.
