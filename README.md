# teams-calendar

To Do;
1. Edit/delete modal
2. Add none value to inputs that are saved empty
3. Design an appropriate delete button



Bugs:
1. If the first word of the title or desccription is too long it spills out of the box
2. Edit modal opens activity as grey color
3. hour long meetings lose the hover effect
4. local storage meetings onclick property for the div, not the input (maybe both)
